# DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOW COST ADAPTIVE HEARING AID

This repository provides the Arduino and MATLAB code for the implementation of a low cost adaptive hearing aid. The hearing aid is able to apply compensatory amplification based on an individual's audiogram and has a user-tunable directionality feature.

The MATLAB GUI provides a fully functioning hearing aid that uses pre-recorded audio. The hardware hearing aid (which uses the Arduino code for signal processing) is a proof of concept of a hearing aid which only processes two frequency bands, rather than the full frequency spectrum of speech.
